## What is the Law

We shall define law as "a set of rules that can be enforced in a court". These rules are different in different countries.

The word **jurisdiction** is used to mean the area covered by a single legal system and set of laws.

Even within a single country, the law and the legal system may be different in different areas (e.g. US with Federal and State laws).

## Criminal Law and Civil Law

### Criminal Law

- Designed to protect society from wrong doers
- Is the popular image of law
- The police are responsible for discovering who has carried out a specific criminal offence and for collecting evidence that will convince a court that the person in question really did commit the offence
- The state, in the form of CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) will then start proceedings by prosecuting the person concerned in a criminal court (**accused** or **defendant**)

### Civil Law

- Setting disputes between people (or companies)
- Litigation must be brought by one of the parties (the **plaintiff**) against another (the **defendant**).

## Where does the law come from?

The two main sources of law in England and Wales are the common law and statute law.
The common law is essentially traditional law that is not written down, but which depends on the judgement of judges over the centuries.
When deciding the rights and wrongs of a case, a court will look at the way in which similar cases have been decided in the past; such cases are known as precedents.

## The legislative process in the UK

Like many other democratic countries, the UK has what is known as a **two-chamber or bicameral legislature**. This means that the law-making body (the legislature) is made up of two chambers or groups of people.

A **Legislative Act of Parliament** (statute) can create, amend, repeal any new or existing law:

- It is introduced in the form of a **bill**; this is a set of proposals that parliament is invited to discuss, possibly modify and then approve.
- The bill is usually introduced first in the House of Commons. It will be discussed and possibly amended there, a process that includes a number of stages.
- If it is approved by the House of Commons, it is passed to the House of Lords.
- If the House of Lords approves the bill, it becomes an Act of Parliament.
- It is then passed to the Queen for her formal approval (the **royal assent**), after which it becomes law.

## European Union

European legislation has hugely affected the UK law system. The EU has its own Parliament, elected by individual voters in all
the member countries. The EU is run by a commission that has the power to issue directives that require member countries to modify their own legislation, if necessary, to meet a common standard.

- Regulations: directly enforceable by Parliament and English courts
- Directives: instructions for member states to alter their laws
- Decisions: specific decisions on states, enterprises, individuals

## Computer Misuse Act (1990)

CMA covers three main offences (see Handout)

- Unauthorized access to a computer
- Unauthorized access to a computer to commit a serious crime
- Unauthorized modification of the contents of a computer

A person is guilty of a crime if either they or the computer in question is in the UK at the time of the offence.

## Review of CMA (2004)

In 2004, the All-Party Parliamentary Internet Group (APIG), a group of British MPs and Members of the House of Lords, carried out a review of the workings of the Computer Misuse Act.

They took evidence from a large number of individuals and organizations, including the BCS and the IEE, many of whom urged the need to extend the Act to include many more specific offences.

Main points:

- Recommended an additional offence of "impairing access to data", which could be used to prosecute the perpetrators of DoS attacks
- Increase from six months to two years in the maximum prison sentence for the unauthorized access offence
- The change would also have the side-effect of making the offence an extraditable one; that is, a British court could order that a person in Britain who was accused of committing the offence in another country could be sent to that country to stand trial.
